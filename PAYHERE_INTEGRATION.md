# PayHere Payment Gateway Integration

This document provides instructions for setting up and using the PayHere payment gateway integration for the Ceylon Mirissa booking system.

## Overview

The PayHere integration allows customers to make secure online payments for package bookings. The system supports both authenticated users and guest bookings with automatic account creation.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. PayHere Account Setup

1. **Create PayHere Account**: Sign up at [PayHere](https://www.payhere.lk/)
2. **Get Merchant Credentials**:
   - Log into your PayHere account
   - Navigate to 'Integrations' section
   - Copy your Merchant ID
3. **Generate Merchant Secret**:
   - Click 'Add Domain/App' in the Integrations section
   - Enter your domain name (e.g., `yourdomain.com`)
   - Request approval (may take up to 24 hours)
   - Once approved, copy the Merchant Secret

### 2. Environment Configuration

Add the following variables to your `.env` file:

```env
# PayHere Payment Gateway Configuration
PAYHERE_MERCHANT_ID=your_merchant_id_here
PAYHERE_MERCHANT_SECRET=your_merchant_secret_here
PAYHERE_SANDBOX_MODE=true
```

**Important**: Set `PAYHERE_SANDBOX_MODE=false` for production.

### 3. Database Migration

Run the migration to add payment fields to the bookings table:

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

## Features

### Payment Flow

1. **Booking Creation**: Customer fills out booking form
2. **Payment Initialization**: System redirects to PayHere payment page
3. **Payment Processing**: Customer completes payment on PayHere
4. **Return Handling**: PayHere redirects back with payment status
5. **Notification Processing**: PayHere sends server-to-server notifications
6. **Booking Confirmation**: Booking status updated based on payment result

### Payment Statuses

- `pending`: Payment initiated but not completed
- `paid`: Payment successful, booking confirmed
- `failed`: Payment failed
- `cancelled`: Payment cancelled by user

### Security Features

- **Hash Verification**: All PayHere communications are verified using HMAC-SHA256
- **Order ID Validation**: Unique order IDs prevent duplicate payments
- **Amount Verification**: Payment amounts are verified against booking totals

## API Endpoints

### Payment Routes

- `GET /payhere/initialize?booking_id={id}` - Initialize payment
- `POST /payhere/return` - Handle successful payment return
- `POST /payhere/cancel` - Handle payment cancellation
- `POST /payhere/notify` - Handle PayHere notifications
- `GET /booking/{id}/success` - Payment success page

## Testing

### Sandbox Testing

1. Set `PAYHERE_SANDBOX_MODE=true` in your `.env` file
2. Use PayHere sandbox test credentials
3. Test with sandbox test cards:
